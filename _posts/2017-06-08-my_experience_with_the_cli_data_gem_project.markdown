     When I was brainstorming ideas for this project, I think I was coming up with apps that were too complicated and more than this particular project was asking for.  I ended up deciding on scraping from Amazon Top Selling Books, but I realized after I had gotten far into the process that when I was trying scrape the details of each books page, there was a robot detector not allowing me to view the html on the page.  I started over by going to the Amazon best sellers page with all the departments and took same code I already had written but used it in a different way.  I was having trouble remembering to push to github so often while I was trying to figure out how I was going to get my app to work.  I knew that it was important that I keep updating my progress and stay organized.  I even thought about completely starting over by making a new gem, but I ended up just downloading an early version of my gem from git hub and started over from there using an interval timer
on my phone that reminded me every 7 minutes to push to github.  Over all this project was a bit overwhelming for me but I am glad I got through it.  It took alot more time than my other Learn projects and I got a little discouraged but I learned a lot and it was good practice using github, scraping websites and just learning how to make a gem from scratch.
