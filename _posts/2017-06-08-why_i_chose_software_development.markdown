   I have always been the creative type.  I can remember my favorite classes as a kid being Art class.  As I grew older, into my middle school and high school years I found a new method of self expression in music and have played in multiple bands to this day.  I knew that the time would come where I would need to think about finding a profession so that I could support myself in the real world even though this seemed to be my true passion.  Though I still have strong ambitions in music, at the same time I need to find something that pays the bills that I can be passionate about in the same  way I am about music and songwriting.  I had been taking different classes at my local community college with no success in finding a career path to take.  Over the summer I came across code academy and flew through the Html, Css and Javascript courses.  This was something that felt like I could get lost in for hours and really enjoy just like if I was working with music editing software, cutting and pasting multiple tracks and tweaking reverbs and volumes.  Thats when I decided to start online courses on learn.
