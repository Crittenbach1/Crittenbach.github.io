This monday marked the start of my job search after graduating Flatiron School.  I have come up with a list of tasks for myself to complete weekly to be sure that I am fulfulling all of the requirements.

My top priorities of each week are:
* Minimum of 5 github commits
* Contact with a minimum of 8 specific individuals at prospective employers within the field matching my program of study
* 1 technical blog post
* solve 3 to 5 problems on HackerRank


The directions I have written for myself to complete my weekly reach outs look like this:

**Step 1**

Look for junior web developer openings on linkedin, indeed, Glassdoor and make a list of companies currently hiring and type up the following notes about the job posting:

Ex:
Company: [Name]
Position: Junior Web Developer
Posted by: [name] / [job title]
[http://link-to-job-posting.com]

**Step 2**

Make a list of recruiters and developers at each company.

**Step 3**

Send a message on linkedin or an email to each recruiter or developer.

I quickly found out that even a free trial premium linkedin account you only are given 5 free inMail messages.

Using the above youtube video I downloaded a very convenient chrome extenstion that saves a lot of time trying to find the correct work email for someone on linkedIn called [GetEmail.io](https://getemail.io/)

**Step 4**

On top of all of these direct emails I am applying to a bunch of angellist start ups.  I have been getting quite a few quick matches.  While I'm not sure that I will end up choosing to work for one of these remote startups, the phone interviews will be great practice for later ones.
