**Introduction**

  _Overview of Course_
  * learn computational modes of thinking 
  * master the art of computational problem solving
  * make computers do what you want them to do 
  
  ___
  
  _Topics_
  
  * represent knowledge with _**data structures**_
  * _**iteration**_ and _**recursion**_ are computational metaphors 
  * _**organize**_ and _**modularize**_ systems using object classes and methods 
  * different classes of _**algorithms**_
  
  ___
  
  _What Does A Computer Do?_
  
  * Fundamentally:
    > * performs _**calculations**_ a billion calculations per second!
    > * _**remembers**_ results -- 100's of gigabytes of storage 
  * What kinds of calculations? 
    > * _**built-in**_ to the language 
    > * ones that _**you define**_ as the programmer 
    
  ___
  
  _Simple Calculations Enough?_
  
  * Searching the World Wide web
    > * 45 Billion Pages; 1,000 words/page; 10 operations/word
    > * Need 5.2 days to find something using simple operations
  * Playing Chess
    > * Average of 35 moves/setting; look ahead 6 moves; 1.8 Billion boards to check; 100 operations/choice
    > * 30 minutes to decide each move
  * Good algorithm design is also needed to accomplish a task!
  
  ___

  _Enough Storage?_
  
  * What if we could just precompute information and then look up the answer?
    > * Playing chess as an example
      > * Experts suggest 10^123 different possible games
        - Only 10^80 atoms in the observable universe (Not enough memory)
  ___
  
  _Are There Limits?_
  
  * Despite it's speed and size, a computer does have limitations 
    > * Some problems wtill too complex
      > * Accurate weather prediction at a local scale
      > * Cracking encryption schemes
    > * Some problems are fundamentally impossible to compute
      > * Predicting whether a piece of code will always halt with an answer for any input
